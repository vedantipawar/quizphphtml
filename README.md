HalloHappiness is a non-governmental organization that provides affordable and evidence-based counselling services through a network of professional counsellors and psychologists. As a part of their efforts to enhance their services, I collaborated with them to develop a website that could accommodate a unique feature for conducting surveys.

To develop the survey feature, I used HTML, CSS, PHP, and Bootstrap to create web pages that enable users to upload a list of questions. The uploaded questions are then converted into a survey that is accessible to all signed-in users on the website. The survey responses are stored in a database for future reference.

The project aims to help HalloHappiness users to assess their mental health and identify areas that may require professional counselling. With this feature, HalloHappiness can better understand the needs of its users and provide tailored services that meet their unique needs.
